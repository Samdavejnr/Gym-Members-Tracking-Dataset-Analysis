# Gym-Members-Tracking-Dataset-Analysis
# Introduction
# This repository contains an analysis of gym members tracking datasets, exploring demographics, physical characteristics, heart rate and fitness, workout habits, health and wellness, correlation and regression analysis, segmentation and clustering, and predictive modeling.
# Dataset Description 
# The dataset consists of 15 rows and 972 columns, including:
# . Demographics: age, gender
# . Physical Characteristics: weight, height, BMI, Resting_BPM
# . Workout habits: workout_type, workout_frequency, Season_Duration
# . Health and wellness: Fat_percentage, water_intake, calories_burned
# Insights and Findings
# Demographics and Physical Characteristics
# . Age distribution
# . Gender distribution 
# . Average weight, height, and BMI for male and female, members
# . Age correlates positively with weight and BMI
# Heart Rate and Fitness
# . Average max_BPM, avg_BPM, and Resting_BPM
# . Workout_type impacts max_BPM and avg_BPM
# . Resting_BPM correlates negatively with experience_level
# Workout Habits
# . Most popular workout_type 
# . Workout_frequency varies by experience_level
# . Season_Duration correlates positively with workout_frequency
# Health and Wellness
# . Average Fat_percentage and water_inatke
# . BMI correlates positively with Fat_percentage and alories_burned
# . Members with higher water_intake tend to have lower Fat_percentage
# Correlateion and Regression Analysis
# . Calories_burned correlates positively with workout_frequency 
# . Experience_level predicts max_BPM and avg_BPM 
# . BMI can be predicted using age, weight, and height
# Segmentation and Clustering 
# . Memebers can be segmented based on workout_type and experience_level
# . Clusters of members with similar physical chracteristics(weight, height, BMI) exist (cluster analysis)
# Predictive Modeling 
# . Calories_burned can be predicted based on workout_type, frequency, and intensity (random forest model)
# . Members at risk of low physical activity can be identified using workout_frequency and BMI (RandomForestClassifier)
# Contribution and Future Work
# . Contributions welcome
# . Future work: explore additional features, improve model accuracy, and investigate causal relationships.
